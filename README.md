In The Stars:

In this cozy and relaxing point-and-click game, you play as a retired professor who returns to his old classroom. You'll discover hints to help draw new constellations in your journal as you explore the room. With soothing music and a warm, inviting atmosphere, this game is the perfect way to unwind and explore the beauty of the night sky. Progress by filling up your journal with constellations, and gaze at your constellations once your notebook is complete.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instructions: 

- Walk around the scene with arrow keys or "WASD"

- Discover hints to help with your drawing by clicking on the objects in the scene

- Click on the Notebook icon in the top left corner to open your journal

- You can draw on the right side, and once complete click on the check mark to check if your drawing is correct

- You can clear your drawings with the X button if you made a mistake

Note: Unfortunately, pressing escape to quit to menu does not work in our WebGL Build. Please instead refresh the page to restart at the main menu at anytime (Progress not saved) Apologies for the inconvenience!
